The images they provide have speckle noise, making their processing and analysis challenging tasks. We discuss an edge detection method based on the fusion of evidences obtained in the intensity channels hh, hv, and vv of PolSAR multi-look images. The method consists of detecting transition points in the thinnest possible range of data that covers two regions using maximum likelihood under the Wishart distribution. The fusion methods used are:  simple average, multi-resolution discrete wavelet transform (MR-DWT), principal component analysis (PCA), ROC statistics, multi-resolution stationary (MR-SWT) wavelet transform, and a multi-resolution method based on singular value decomposition (MR-SVD). A quantitative analysis suggests that PCA and MR-SVD provide the best results.},

  abstract = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) systems are an important remote sensing tool. Such systems can provide high spacial resolution images, but they are contaminated by an interference pattern called multidimensional speckle. This fact requires that PolSAR images receive specialised treatment; particularly, tailored models which are close to PolSAR physical formation are sought. In this paper, we propose two new matrix models which arise from applying the stochastic summation approach to PolSAR, called compound truncated Poisson complex Wishart (CTPCW) and compound geometric complex Wishart (CGCW) distributions. These models offer the unique ability to express multimodal data. Some of their mathematical properties are derived and discussed— characteristic function and Mellin-kind log-cumulants (MLCs). Moreover, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedures via expectation maximisation algorithm for CTPCW and CGCW parameters are furnished as well as MLC-based goodness-of-fit graphical tools. Monte Carlo experiment results indicate ML estimates perform at what is asymptotically expected (small bias and mean square error) even for small sample sizes. Finally, our proposals are employed to describe actual PolSAR images, presenting evidence that they can outperform other well-known distributions, such as WmC, Gm0 , and Km.},

The G0 distribution is a statistical model that succeeds in describing a wide range of areas as, for instance in SAR data, pastures (smooth), forests (rough) and urban (extremely rough) areas. In order to determine boundaries between different areas, dynamic B-splines are proposed in this paper. The algorithm automatically finds seeds and regions boundaries by a decision rule based on the estimation of the parameters of the G0 law. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real SAR images, and both the accuracy and the performance of the proposal are assessed.},

These data have been statistically modeled by a multiplicative model using the G0 distribution, under which regions with different degrees of roughness can be characterized by the value of a parameter. We use this information to find boundaries between regions with different textures. We propose and compare five strategies for boundary detection: three based on the data (maximum discontinuity on raw data, fractal dimension and maximum likelihood) and two based on estimates of the roughness parameter (maximum discontinuity and anisotropic smoothed roughness estimates). In order to compare these strategies, a Monte Carlo experience was performed to assess the accuracy of fitting a curve to a region. The probability of finding the correct edge with less than a specified error is estimated and used to compare the techniques. The two best procedures are then compared in terms of their computational cost and, finally, we show that the maximum likelihood approach on the raw data using the G0 law is the best technique.},

We derive geodesic distances between models that describe several practical situations, assuming the number of looks known, for same and different tex- ture and for same and different scale. We then apply this new tool to the problems of identifying edges between regions with different texture, and quantify the dissimilarity between pairs of samples in actual SAR data.

However, PolSAR images are contaminated by speckle noise due to the coherent illumination employed during the data acquisition. This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its processing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper discusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. In all methods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest possible strip of data which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the transitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two differences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under the scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the       class of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was quantified and analyzed by the computa- tional time and probability of correct edge detection, with respect to the number of looks, the backscatter matrix as a whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection procedures were applied to three real PolSAR images. Results provide evidence that the methods based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the difference of Shannon entropies outperform the other techniques.},

abstract="Extraction of features, such as edges for the understanding of aerial images, has been an important objective since the early days of remote sensing. This work aims at describing a new framework which allows for the quantitative combination of a preselected set of edge detectors based on the correspondence between their outcomes. This is inspired from the problem that despite the enormous amount of literature on edge detection techniques, there is no single technique that performs well in every possible image context. Two approaches are proposed for this purpose. The first approach is the well-known receiver operating characteristics analysis which is introduced for a sound quality evaluation of the edge maps estimated by combining different edge detectors. In the second approach, the so-called kappa statistics are employed in a novel fashion to amalgamate the above-mentioned selected edge maps to form an improved final edge image. This method is unique in the sense that the balance between the false detections (false positives and false negatives) is explicitly determined in advance and incorporated in the proposed method in a mathematical fashion. For the performance evaluation of the proposed techniques, a sample set of the RADIUS/DARPA-IU Fort Hood aerial image database with known ground truth has been used.",

ABSTRACT = {Coastal regions and surface waters are among the fundamental biological and social development resources worldwide. For this reason, it is essential to thoroughly monitor these regions to determine and characterize their geographical features and environmental health. These geographical regions, however, present several monitoring challenges when using remotely sensed imagery. Small water bodies tend to be surrounded by swamps, marshes, or vegetation, making accurate border detection difficult. Coastal waters, in turn, experience several phenomena due to winds, undercurrents, and waves, which also hamper the detection of environmental hazards like oil spills. In this work, we propose an automated segmentation algorithm that can be applied to these targets in airborne and spaceborne SAR images. The method is based on pointwise detection in fuzzy borders using a parameter estimation of the G0 distribution, which has been successfully used in similar contexts. The underlying assumption is that the sought-for border separates regions with different textures, each having different distribution parameters. Then, stochastic distances can identify the most likely point where this parameter change occurs. A curve interpolation algorithm then estimates the actual contour of the body given the detected points. We assess the adequacy of eight stochastic distances that are mostly applied in the literature. We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of similarity between true and detected boundaries on simulated and actual SAR images, achieving promising results. The performance of our proposal is assessed by Hausdorff distance and Intersection over Union. In the case of synthetic data, the selection of the best stochastic distance depends on the parameters of the GI0 distribution. In contrast, the harmonic-mean and triangular distances produced the best results in detecting borders in three actual SAR images of lagoons. Finally, we present the results of our proposal applied to an image with oil spills using Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, and Jensen&ndash;Shannon distances.},
